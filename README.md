# Final Project Introduction to Machine Learning: Supervised Learning (CSCA5622)

* This project aims to predict house prices based on the Ames Housing Dataset using various supervised learning algorithms. 
* Algorithms like linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR and KNN are used.
* A continuous numerical value (house price) is predicted and therefore it is a regression task.

## Project Motivation and Goal

* The motivation of the project is to apply the theory which was learned in this course. 
* The goal of the project is to compare different algorithms against each other and find a good prediction for the task at hand. Furthermore the results shall be discussed.
